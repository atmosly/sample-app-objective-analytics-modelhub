# Objectiv open model hub - Development

Here you'll find instructions for development on the open model hub. If you want to contribute (Thank you!), please take a look at the [Contribution Guide](https://www.objectiv.io/docs/home/the-project/contribute) in our Docs. It contains information about our contribution process and where you can fit in.

## Set up development environment

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH=.

# Install both Bach and ModelHub in local 'edit' mode
pip install -e ../bach
pip install -e .[dev]
# The above will fail if the postgres lib development headers are not present. On Ubuntu that can be fixed
# with: sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
```

### PyCharm

* Mark the following directories as "Sources root":
    1. `/bach/`
    2. `/modelhub/`
* Set `modelhub/venv/bin/python` as the default interpreter for the project
